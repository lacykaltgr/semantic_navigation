Based on the provided global context, I would label the image as "Reception". 

I made this decision based on the presence of a large desk or counter in the center of the room, which is typically found in a reception area. 
The room appears to be well-lit and has a formal atmosphere, consistent with a reception area in an office building. 
Additionally, the presence of chairs and a plant suggests that this is a public area where people may wait to be greeted or assisted. 
Overall, the layout and decor of the room are consistent with a reception area in an office building.
