The input to the model is a 3D scene described in a JSON format. 

The JSON includes:
A "global_context" field, which provides an overall description of the environment (e.g., office, hospital).
A list of clustered spaces representing rooms or other distinct parts of the building. Each cluster contains an "objects" field, listing the detected items present in the space, and an "image_descriptions" field, containing guessed labels and descriptions for images taken in that cluster. 
Note that the image descriptions and guessed labels may be unreliable and should not be taken for granted.

Example Input:

{
  "global_context": "description of the building (e.g., office, hospital)",
  "clusters": [
    {
      "cluster_id": 1,
      "objects": ["object1", "object2", ...],
      "image_descriptions": [
        {
          "label": "hallway",
          "description": "Description for the image ..."
        },
        {
          "label": "reception",
          "description": "Description for another image ..."
        }
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Label each cluster based on the global context, the items within the cluster, and the image descriptions, while considering that the provided image descriptions may be inaccurate. 
Output the results as a JSON array of objects, where each object includes:

"cluster_id": The ID of the cluster.
"label": A concise label that best describes the cluster's purpose or function.
"description": A brief explanation of why the label was chosen, considering the global context, objects, and image descriptions.

Example Output:

[
  {
    "cluster_id": 1,
    "label": "hallway",
    "description": "A long, narrow corridor with a white tiled floor and a few potted plants, likely a common area connecting different parts of the office."
  },
  {
    "cluster_id": 2,
    "label": "reception",
    "description": "A long counter with a sign that reads 'RECEPTION' and a few plants in the background, consistent with the global context of an office with a reception area."
  }
]

Make sure the labels are concise while accurately capturing the function of each cluster.
Use maximum 1 sentence for each cluster description.
Make sure to give your response in JSON format, based on the example output.
Do not add any other text to the response, other than the JSON output.
